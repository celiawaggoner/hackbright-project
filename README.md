Pulse is a fullstack web application that helps people discover new workout studios. The app uses the Yelp and Google Maps APIs to display details and locations of workout studios based on a user's search. Users can also create an account in order to review studios and instructors, save their favorite studios, and set weighted preferences in order to view an individualized score for each studio.
